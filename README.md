Oumi is a community-first, end-to-end platform for advanced AI research and development. It provides comprehensive support for foundation model workflows - from pretraining and post-training, to data curation, synthesis and evaluation. Built with enterprise-grade quality and reliability, Oumi serves both researchers pushing the boundaries of AI and organizations building production-ready solutions.

## Features

Oumi is designed to be fully flexible yet easy to use:

- **Run Anywhere**: Train and evaluate models seamlessly across environments - from local machines to remote clusters, with native support for Jupyter notebooks and VS Code debugging.

- **Comprehensive Training**: Support for the full ML lifecycle - from pretraining to fine-tuning (SFT, LoRA, QLoRA, DPO) to evaluation. Built for both research exploration and production deployment.

- **Built for Scale**: First-class support for distributed training with PyTorch DDP and FSDP. Efficiently handle models up to 405B parameters.

- **Reproducible Research**: Version-controlled configurations via YAML files and CLI arguments ensure fully reproducible experiments across training and evaluation pipelines.

- **Unified Interface**: One consistent interface for everything - data processing, training, evaluation, and inference. Seamlessly work with both open models and commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI).

- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new models, datasets, training approaches and evaluation metrics. Built with modularity in mind.

- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive test coverage, detailed documentation, and enterprise-grade support make Oumi reliable for both research and production use cases.

We're just getting started on this journey, and we can't wait to build Oumi together! If there's a feature that you think is missing, let us know or join us in making it a reality:

For a full tour of what Oumi can do, dive into our [documentation](https://oumi.ai/docs).

## Getting Started

With just a couple commands you can install Oumi, train, infer, and evaluate. All it would take is something like the following:

### Installation

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:oumi-ai/oumi.git
cd oumi

# Install the package (CPU & NPU only)
pip install -e .  # For local development & testing

# OR, with GPU support (Requires Nvidia or AMD GPU)
pip install -e ".[gpu]"  # For GPU training
```

### Usage

   ```shell
   # Training
   oumi train -c configs/recipes/smollm/sft/135m/train_quickstart.yaml

   # Evaluation
   oumi evaluate -c configs/recipes/smollm/evaluation/135m_eval_quickstart.yaml \
   --lm_harness_params.tasks "[m_mmlu_en]"

   # Inference
   oumi infer -c configs/recipes/smollm/inference/135m_infer.yaml \
   --generation.max_new_tokens 40 \
   --generation.temperature 0.7 \
   --interactive
   ```

   For more advanced training options, see the [training guide](/docs/user_guides/train/train.md) and [distributed training](docs/advanced/distributed_training.md).
