    "\n",
    "🚀 Oumi is a fully open-source platform that streamlines the entire lifecycle of foundation models - from [data preparation](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/resources/datasets/datasets.html) and [training](hhttps://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/train/train.html) to [evaluation](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/evaluate/evaluate.html) and [deployment](https://oumi.ai/docs/en/latest/user_guides/launch/launch.html). Whether you're developing on a laptop, launching large scale experiments on a cluster, or deploying models in production, Oumi provides the tools and workflows you need.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is recommended to run this notebook on a machine with GPU support, as vLLM is mainly intended to run on GPUs. Llama 3.3 70B requires 140GB VRAM to serve, though we also provide examples below for inference with Llama 3.1 8B and quantized Llama 3.3 70B that require less memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your local machine cannot run this notebook, you can instead run this notebook on a cloud platform. The following demonstrates how to open a VSCode instance backed by a GCP node with 4 A100 GPUs, from which the notebook can be run.\n",

    "gcloud auth application-default login  # Authenticate with GCP\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Llama Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama 3.3 70B is a gated model on HuggingFace Hub. To run this notebook, you must first complete the [agreement](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct) on HuggingFace, and wait for it to be accepted. Then, specify `HF_TOKEN` below to enable access to the model.\n",
